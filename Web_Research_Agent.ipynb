Triggered largely by human activities, this phenomenon poses significant challenges to natural ecosystems and human society.

            "## 1. What are the main causes of climate change?\n",
            "\n",
            "The primary driver behind climate change is the greenhouse effect, where greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun in Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming (climate.ec.europa.eu). Human activities, notably the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, are the most significant contributors, accounting for approximately 68% of global greenhouse gas emissions (un.org). Activities like deforestation and wetland degradation further intensify the concentration of these gases (nrdc.org). Methane, alongside carbon dioxide, plays a crucial role in exacerbating global warming, particularly in the short term (climate.ec.europa.eu). While natural processes such as volcanic activity contribute to climate change, their emissions are significantly lower compared to anthropogenic sources (epa.gov).\n",

            "## 2. How has the global temperature changed over the past century?\n",
            "\n",
            "The past century has witnessed a noticeable increase in the Earth's average global temperature, rising by approximately 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 degrees Fahrenheit) (theworldcounts.com). The global surface temperature increased by about 0.6 degrees Celsius during the 20th century (archive.ipcc.ch). Since 1901, this temperature rise has occurred at an average rate of 0.17 degrees Fahrenheit per decade (epa.gov). From a broader historical perspective, the average global temperature has increased by at least 1.1 degrees Celsius (1.9 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1880 (earthobservatory.nasa.gov). Since 1975, combined land and ocean temperatures have been warming at an average rate of 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit (0.20 degrees Celsius) per decade (climate.gov).\n",

            "A variety of policies have been implemented worldwide to combat climate change, with an emphasis on real-world results and necessary compromises. In the United States, individual states are adopting measures such as carbon pricing, emission limits, renewable portfolio standards, and promoting cleaner transportation (c2es.org). Globally, countries are developing policies that reconcile environmental goals with economic realities (worldbank.org). Some U.S. states are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions through carbon markets, clean energy standards, and investments, independent of federal policy (css.umich.edu). A significant legislative effort is represented by the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S., which aims to significantly reduce emissions (2021-2025.state.gov).\n",

            "Climate change has dramatically increased the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, adversely affecting biodiversity (royalsociety.org). Shifts in climate patterns disrupt natural cycles, posing extinction threats to certain species (greenpeace.org.uk). Changes in temperature and precipitation exacerbate pressures on species, intensifying their vulnerability to human activities (royalsociety.org). Additionally, climate change facilitates the expansion of invasive species, which compete with native species, disrupting local ecosystems (greenpeace.org.uk).

            "\n",
            "The influence of climate change on natural disasters is evident in the increased frequency and severity of events such as heatwaves, droughts, wildfires, and floods (bbc.com). Rising temperatures augment evaporation rates, contributing to more frequent and intense rainfall events, which can trigger landslides and floods (pbs.org). Furthermore, higher global temperatures have the potential to increase the wind speeds of tropical storms (earthobservatory.nasa.gov). The United States has seen an increase in billion-dollar disasters over the past decade, with climate change being a key factor in their rising frequency and intensity (climate.gov). Sea-level rise and shifts in water availability further exacerbate the occurrence and severity of natural disasters like floods and hurricanes (usgs.gov).\n",

            "\n",
            "Renewable energy sources are crucial in alleviating climate change by significantly reducing carbon emissions when replacing fossil fuels (researchgate.net). They promote sustainable development by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing energy efficiency (journalspub.com). Solar and wind power, in particular, are standout sources as they produce electricity without emitting carbon, thus bolstering air quality and mitigating climate impacts (energydigital.com).
